        <h1>Who are we and What we Do.</h1>
        <p id="essay">My name is Jake Smith and today I will introduce you to our team!
            “Clovamare” comes from the words “clover” and “amare”. Clover symbolizes 
            the Earth and “amare” is Latin for “love” which means that our team loves the earth. 
            Our team consists of five passionate individuals who have come together 
            to shed light on essential topics that play a significant role in preserving our planet. 
            We believe that by taking collective action, we can make a positive impact 
            and create a more sustainable future for all. Let's dive into the importance 
            of using eco bags instead of plastic, proper waste disposal, volunteering in community clean-ups, tree planting, and conserving water.
            Plastic pollution is a severe global issue, and one way we can combat it is by using eco bags instead of plastic. Did you know that non-biodegradable plastics can take up to 500 years to decompose? Eco bags are reusable, reducing the demand for single-use plastics. 
            By making this simple switch, we can drastically reduce the amount of plastic waste in 
            environment, which can take hundreds of years to decompose. 
            Using eco bags is a small change with a big impact.
            Solid waste management is considered a pressing global issue calling for an 
            immediate response from the government and its people.
            In the Philippines, a single human can generate up to 0.4 kilos of solid waste daily. 
            The Philippines, with a population of over 100 million, is producing over 
            21 million metric tons of garbage every year. Considering the overpopulation in the country, 
            numbers are expected to skyrocket with the current approach in waste disposal.
            Even after implementing the 3R's in the Philippines, 
            we can notice these garbage bins that even though do they 
            have labels, it's still used as a universal trash bin that 
            all biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and even toxic wastes 
            fall into one place. We Need to take our Solid Waste Management Seriously!
            By practicing proper Solid Waste Management, we can Reduce waste in 
            landfills, reduce pollution, Reduce greenhouse gasses, and also, Reduce the cost of waste disposal.
            We need everyone to cooperate, including YOU. Let's conserve and save the only world we have and together
